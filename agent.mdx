the `Agent` class represents a voice agent that will call your voice agent for testing purposes. it defines the characteristics and behavior of the test agent through a prompt and voice settings.

    name: str,
    prompt: str,
    voice_id: str = "79a125e8-cd45-4c13-8a67-188112f4dd22"
)
```

### parameters

- `name` (str): the name of the agent (used when displaying test results)

- `voice_id` (str, optional): the cartesia voice id for the agent. defaults to a british female voice.

## example usage

```python

    name="jessica",
    prompt="you are a young woman named jessica who says 'like' a lot",
    voice_id="b7d50908-b17c-442d-ad8d-810c63997ed9"
)
```

## notes

- the agent's prompt should define its personality, speaking patterns, and any specific behaviors you want it to exhibit during the test call.
- the voice id determines how the agent will sound during the call. you can use different voices to test how your system handles various speaker characteristics.
