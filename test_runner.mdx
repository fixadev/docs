## overview

the `TestRunner` class is responsible for executing tests by managing the test server, making calls, and collecting results. it coordinates the entire testing process.

## constructor

```python
TestRunner(
    port: int,
    ngrok_url: str,
    twilio_phone_number: str,
    evaluator: BaseEvaluator | None = None
)
```

### parameters

- `port` (int): the port to run the test server on
- `ngrok_url` (str): the ngrok url for external access to the test server
- `twilio_phone_number` (str): the phone number to use as the "from" number for outbound test calls
- `evaluator` (BaseEvaluator | None, optional): the evaluator to use for assessing test results. defaults to none.

## constants

- `INBOUND`: Constant for inbound call type
- `OUTBOUND`: Constant for outbound call type

## methods

### `add_test()`

adds a test to the test runner.

```python
def add_test(self, test: Test)
```

### `run_tests()`

runs all added tests and returns the results.

```python
async def run_tests(
    phone_number: str,
    type: str = OUTBOUND
) -> List[TestResult]
```

#### parameters

- `phone_number` (str): the phone number to call or receive calls from
- `type` (str, optional): the type of calls to make (INBOUND or OUTBOUND). defaults to OUTBOUND.

#### returns

- List[TestResult]: the results of all executed tests

## example usage

```python
# initialize test runner
test_runner = TestRunner(
    port=8765,
    ngrok_url=listener.url(),
    twilio_phone_number=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
    evaluator=LocalEvaluator()
)

# add tests
test_runner.add_test(test1)
test_runner.add_test(test2)

# run tests
test_results = await test_runner.run_tests(
    phone_number=PHONE_NUMBER_TO_CALL,
    type=TestRunner.OUTBOUND
)
```

## features

- manages a fastapi server for handling calls
- coordinates with twilio for making/receiving calls
- executes multiple tests in parallel
- collects and evaluates test results
- supports both inbound and outbound testing

## notes

- requires environment variables for various api keys (twilio, openai, etc.)
- uses ngrok for exposing the local server to the internet
- can run multiple tests simultaneously
- supports different types of evaluators (local/cloud)
- handles test execution, result collection, and cleanup
