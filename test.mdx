## overview

the `Test` class represents a test case that combines a scenario with an agent. it defines what will be tested and which agent will perform the test.

## constructor

    scenario: Scenario,
    agent: Agent
)
```

### parameters

- `scenario` (Scenario): the scenario to test
- `agent` (Agent): the agent to test with

## example usage

```python
# create an agent
agent = Agent(
    name="jessica",
    prompt="you are a young woman named jessica who says 'like' a lot"
)

# create a scenario
scenario = Scenario(
    name="order_donut",
    prompt="order a dozen donuts with sprinkles and a coffee",
    evaluations=[
        Evaluation(name="order_success", prompt="the order was successful"),
        Evaluation(name="price_confirmed", prompt="the agent confirmed the price of the order"),
    ]
)

# create a test
test = Test(scenario=scenario, agent=agent)

# add to test runner
test_runner.add_test(test)
```

## notes

- a test is the combination of what to test (scenario) and who will test it (agent)
- multiple tests can be created with different scenario-agent combinations
- tests are executed by the testrunner
- each test will result in a separate call to your voice agent
