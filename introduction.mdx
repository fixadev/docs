## overview

fixa uses a voice agent to call your voice agent and an LLM to evaluate how the conversation went.

under the hood, this package uses:

- [Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) for the agent
- Cartesia for TTS
- Deepgram for transcription
- OpenAI for the evaluator
- Twilio to initiate calls

(other integrations coming soon)
