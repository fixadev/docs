---

## overview

the `Scenario` class represents a test scenario that defines what the test agent should do when calling your voice agent. it includes a prompt for the agent's behavior and a set of evaluation criteria to assess the interaction.

## constructor

```python
Scenario(
    name: str,
    prompt: str,
    evaluations: List[Evaluation] = []
)
```

### parameters

- `name` (str): the name of the scenario
- `prompt` (str): the system prompt that defines what the agent should do in this scenario
- `evaluations` (List[Evaluation], optional): list of evaluation criteria to assess the scenario. defaults to an empty list.

## methods

### to_dict()

converts the scenario to a dictionary format, useful for serialization.

```python
def to_dict(self) -> dict
```

returns a dictionary containing the scenario's name, prompt, and evaluations.

## example usage

```python
scenario = Scenario(
    name="order_donut",
    prompt="order a dozen donuts with sprinkles and a coffee",
    evaluations=[
        Evaluation(name="order_success", prompt="the order was successful"),
        Evaluation(name="price_confirmed", prompt="the agent confirmed the price of the order"),
    ]
)
```

## notes

- the scenario prompt should clearly define the task or interaction you want to test
- each scenario can have multiple evaluation criteria to assess different aspects of the interaction
- scenarios are used in combination with agents to create tests
